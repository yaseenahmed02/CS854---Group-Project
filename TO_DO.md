- Implement a token counter/limit for the retrieval step, to create a condition comparable to the original SWE-bench RAG experiment, that used 13k/27k/50k tokens for the retrieval step.
- Check token limits (input and output) for the VLM generation step. 
- Check any places where token limits are hard coded and consider how it influences.
